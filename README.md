# DApp NFT Marketplace

This is a decentralized application (DApp) NFT Marketplace built on Ethereum blockchain using Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js, and React. The marketplace allows users to buy and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs) securely and transparently.

## Features
1. Create and mint NFTs: Users can create and mint their own unique NFTs using the smart contract.
2. Buy and sell NFTs: Users can browse the marketplace and purchase NFTs listed by other users. They can also list their own NFTs for sale.
3. Wallet integration: Users can connect their Ethereum wallet using Ethers.js to interact with the marketplace, view their NFTs, and make transactions securely.
4. Ownership and authenticity: NFTs are secured using the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring verifiable ownership and authenticity of digital assets.

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Ethereum wallet: Install an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask to interact with the marketplace using your Ethereum account.

### Installation
1. Clone this repo
    ```git clone <repo_name>```
2. Create a .env file with the following vars:
   
    ```API_URL=https://testnet.aurora.dev```
    ```PRIVATE_KEY=<private_key_of_your_account>```
3. ```cd web3-build-hackathon```
4. ```npm install```
5. ```npx hardhat run src/backend/scripts/deploy.js --network aurora```
6. ```npm run start```

### Usage
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet: Click on the "Connect Wallet" button and follow the prompts to connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the DApp.
2. Create and mint NFTs: Use the DApp's interface to create and mint your own NFTs. Specify the token details, upload the associated media, and set a price for sale if desired.
3. Browse and purchase NFTs: Explore the marketplace to discover NFTs listed by other users. Click on an NFT to view its details, including the owner and price. To purchase an NFT, click on the "Buy" button and confirm the transaction using your connected wallet.
4. Sell your NFTs: List your minted NFTs for sale by specifying a price. Other users can then browse and purchase your NFTs if interested.
